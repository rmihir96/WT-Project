		<!-- C -->
		<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-center w3-padding-128" id="clang">
			<h2>C</h2>
			<h4>Course Outcome</h4>
			<p> Learn how to program in C, Learn about program flow, Learn about functions, methods and routines, How to use arguments and return values, How to run a simple C program.</p>
			<h4>Why learn C?</h4>
			<p>If you are a student wanting to learn C programming, or an adult learner simply researching C programming courses, this free introductory course is for you. The C programming language is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is a general-purpose programming language and there are very few computer systems in existence that are not set up for its use (i.e. where a C compiler does not exist). This C programming tutorial and course introduces you to the basics of programming in C. You will learn how programming languages work with data, what program flow is, and how to use functions, methods and routines. You will also get step-by-step instructions on how to create simple C programs and how to run them all while you learn C programming. </p>
