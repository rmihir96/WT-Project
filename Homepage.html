		<h2>Why does MentorSpot exist?</h2>
		<p>
		
		MentorSpot.com is a website which helps people learn from many MOOCs available on the internet without losing motivation and getting personalized advice by mentors who are experts in their respective fields and also who reside near them. The website is built around the idea of collective learning and growth, where users help other users to learn and guide them through the duration of course. Thus the websites will have two types of users: Mentors who are expert in a particular field or course, and learners who are learning or intend to learn a particular course. It gives the students all the more reason to study a particular subject/ topic in detail besides sharing a quick view on the struggles of the Master. We at envisage to create a parallel learning system that is lesser theoretical and integrate it with their regular curriculum so that lack of option becomes the last deterrent for a student to pursue his/ her interest.
